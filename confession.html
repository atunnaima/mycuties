                For the past few weeks, I never really realized much but now that I did, I feel like you are really something special and dearly to me. Ever since the whole king situation, meeting you felt like a huge change and I really want to express to you how I really felt. I never expected us to be this close and I never regret any single minute of it. You mean so much to me to the point I see you as part of me. Receiving lovely messages by you make up most of my days. You never fail to make me smile, even when I’m dealing with my own issues due to past trauma, I love how you are being very patient with me, even though I am being quite dry to you. Even if I don’t look like I love you, deep down I really love you but too afraid to express it out, scared I will be overly clingy and end up hurting you. Yet you accept me for who I am, I am lucky to have someone like you. The moment when you confessed to me, at first I felt the joy and who would have thought that you would actually confessed first even though I might have assumed you have another girls. The moment I knew I fall in love with you are when I realize both of us have the same things in common as If I’m talking with myself but better version of me. The moment I really knew this was it when you told your friend I was the reason your midnight sickness started going away, well I got to thanks Maz for staying in the game and took screenshots of it, never knew you feel that way about me, it make me fall for you even more. I love you so much Dan. After all the thoughts and consideration, I’ve finally made up my mind to accept this relationship and make it as official.
